In order to write to the DataOne (GMN) server, you need to authenticate as a user
that has those privileges. There is no way to authenticate from within the Java code,
you must do it using SSL certificates.

The server has certificates that it trusts, see this for more info:
	http://pythonhosted.org/dataone.generic_member_node/setup-local-authn-ca.html
  
You need two things to create the required x509 file on your machine:
	-the client certificate, e.g: /var/local/dataone/certs/client/client_cert.pem
	-the client private key, e.g: /var/local/dataone/certs/client/client_key_nopassword.pem

Once you have both of these, create the following file:
	/tmp/x509up_u1000
...and in it, first paste the certificate, then the private key so it looks like:
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
	<snip...cert content>
	-----END CERTIFICATE-----
	-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
	<snip...key content>
	-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
	
You can now run this Java eml-poster client and authenticate correctly.

Note: the trust script DOES NOT create this certificate for you!
